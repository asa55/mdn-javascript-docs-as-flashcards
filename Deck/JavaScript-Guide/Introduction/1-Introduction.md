Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic **control** over them.

##

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as:

- `_____`
- `_____`
- `_____`

%

- `Array`
- `Date`
- and `Math`

##

JavaScript contains a core set of language elements such as 

- `_____`
- `_____`
- `_____`

%

- operators
- control structures
- and statements

##

Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:

- `_____`
- `_____`

%

- Client-side JavaScript
- Server-side JavaScript

##

`_____`-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, `_____`-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.

`_____`-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a `_____`.

JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed to JavaScript from

In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a `_____`-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The `_____`-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.

##

JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly

typed

##

Java is a class-based programming language designed for fast execution and type safety. Type safety means, for instance, that you can't cast a Java integer into an object reference or access private memory by corrupting the Java bytecode. Java's class-based model means that programs consist exclusively of classes and their methods. Java's class inheritance and strong typing generally require tightly coupled object hierarchies. These requirements make Java programming more complex than

JavaScript descends in spirit from a line of smaller, dynamically typed languages such as `_____` and `_____`. These scripting languages offer programming tools to a much wider audience because of their easier syntax, specialized built-in functionality, and minimal requirements for object creation.

Getting started with JavaScript is easy: all you need is a modern

Web browser

The Web Console tool built into Firefox is useful for experimenting with JavaScript; you can use it in two modes:

- `_____`
- `_____`

%

- single-line input mode
- multi-line input mode

##

The Web Console shows you information about the currently loaded Web page, and also includes a JavaScript `_____` that you can use to execute JavaScript expressions in the current page.

The Web Console (or just "console") works the exact same way as `eval`: the last expression entered is `_____`. For the sake of simplicity, it can be imagined that every time something is entered into the console, it is actually surrounded by `console.log` around `eval`, like so:

`console.log(eval('3 + 5'))`

##

The single-line input mode of the Web Console is great for quick testing of JavaScript expressions, but although you can execute multiple lines, it's not very convenient for that. For more complex JavaScript, you can use the **multi**-line input mode.

##

Remember to always include `_____` before your code, and add `_____` to the end of your code. The strict mode and IIFE articles explain what those do, but for now they can be thought of as doing the following:

1. Prevent semantics in JavaScript that trip up beginners.
2. Prevent code snippets executed in the console from interacting with one-another (e.g., having something created in one console execution being used for a different console execution).

%

Remember to always include `(function(){"use strict";` before your code, and add `})();` to the end of your code.
